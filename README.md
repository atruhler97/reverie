# Reverie

**Reverie is a browser-based app that helps families preserve the voices, stories, and wisdom of their loved ones.**

This MVP guides users through reflective prompts, lets them record audio responses, and transcribes their words using OpenAI’s Whisper API. Each recording becomes part of a personal “memory capsule” that can be replayed, re-read, and cherished across generations.
